* This program can decrypt a message crypted according to the Atbash Mirror.

* It is precisely the reverse of encryption, namely the replacement of each letter by its opposite depending of the middle of the alphabet (conventional or shifted).

* To compile this program, just start the make command.

* To execute it, start the following command: ./decrypt_atbash [encrypted_file] [decrypted_file].
